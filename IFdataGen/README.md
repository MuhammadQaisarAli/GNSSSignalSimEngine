# IFdataGen - SignalSim IF Data Generator

## Overview

IFdataGen is a component of the SignalSim project that generates GNSS Intermediate Frequency (IF) data for various satellite navigation systems. The generated binary files can be used with RF front-ends or GNSS software-defined radio applications.

## Signal Support and Testing Status

The following table shows the current testing status of various GNSS signals in SignalSim:

> **Legend**:
>
> - ðŸŸ¢ Working / Complete: Feature has been fully implemented and verified
> - ðŸŸ¡ Limited / Partial: Feature has partial implementation or limited verification
> - ðŸ”´ Not Working: Feature is not implemented or not functioning correctly

### Note

> The `"Testing Status"` indicates that the signals for the respective frequency bands have been successfully generated. However, the detailed evaluation of their characteristicsâ€”such as spectral purity, phase noise, modulation accuracy, and overall signal integrityâ€”has not yet been performed.â€‹

## Build Instructions on Windows

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio (tested with VS 2022)
- CMake support enabled in Visual Studio (included by default in recent versions)

### Steps to Build IFdataGen

#### 1. Obtain the Repository

Either clone the repository to your PC:

``` cmd
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadQaisarAli/SignalSim.git
```

Or download the ZIP archive and extract it.

#### 2. Open the Project Folder

- Launch Visual Studio
- Navigate to File > Open > Folder...
- Browse to the cloned SignalSim repository and select the `SignalSim` folder

#### 3. Configure the CMake Project

- Upon opening the folder, Visual Studio will detect the `CMakeLists.txt` files and a `CMake Integration` popup will appear
  
  ![CMake Integration Popup](images/CMakeIntegrationPopup.png)
  
- Click `Enable and set source directory` and select the `CMakeLists.txt` file located at `<path-to-repo>/SignalSim/IFdataGen/CMakeLists.txt`
- Wait for the configuration process to complete. You should see this output in the console:

  ``` cmd
  1> Extracted CMake variables.
  1> Extracted source files and headers.
  1> Extracted code model.
  1> Extracted toolchain configurations.
  1> Extracted includes paths.
  1> CMake generation finished.
  ```

#### 4. Build the Project

- Once the configuration is complete, build the project by navigating to Build > Build All or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`
- Upon successful build, you should see:

  ``` cmd
  [32/32] Linking CXX executable IFdataGen.exe

  Build All succeeded.
  ```

- The `IFdataGen.exe` executable will be generated in `<path-to-repo>/SignalSim/IFdataGen/out/build/x64-Debug/` folder

## Running IFdataGen

### 1. Configure the Input JSON File

- Navigate to the `/SignalSim/IFdataGen/` directory and open `IfGenTest.json` in a text editor
- Update the `ephemeris` section with the absolute path to your RINEX file:

  ```json
  "ephemeris": {
      "type": "RINEX",
      "name": "D:/SignalSim/IFdataGen/EphData/BRDC00IGS_R_20211700000_01D_MN.rnx"
  }
  ```

- The provided `BRDC00IGS_R_20211700000_01D_MN.rnx` is a mixed RINEX file containing data for multiple constellations (GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, GLONASS)
- By default, only GPS L1CA signals are selected for generation

### 2. Generate the IF Data

- Open a command prompt in the build directory `<path-to-repo>/SignalSim/IFdataGen/out/build/x64-Debug/`
- Run the following command:

  ```cmd
  IFdataGen.exe "<path-to-repo>/SignalSim/IFdataGen/IfGenTest.json"
  ```

  Example:

  ```cmd
  IFdataGen.exe "D:/SignalSim/IFdataGen/IfGenTest.json"
  ```
  
- On successful execution, you'll see output similar to:

  ``` cmd
    Generate IF data with following satellite signals:
    GPS visible SVs 9.
    BDS visible SVs 0.
    Galileo visible SVs 0.
    Glonass visible SVs 0.

    GPS L1CA with IF -4580kHz
            SV03 with Doppler -3765Hz
            SV04 with Doppler -1899Hz
            SV07 with Doppler 893Hz
            SV08 with Doppler 2480Hz
            SV09 with Doppler 133Hz
            SV14 with Doppler 3721Hz
            SV16 with Doppler -3263Hz
            SV27 with Doppler 1169Hz
            SV30 with Doppler 2352Hz
  Generate IF data completed    490 ms
  ```

- A binary file `IfGenTest8.bin` will be created in the same directory as the executable

## Using the Generated Data

The generated binary file can be:

- Fed into RF front-end hardware such as HackRF, PlutoSDR, etc.
- Processed by GNSS software like GNSS-SDR or PocketSDR
- Used for testing and development of GNSS signal processing algorithms

## Supported Constellations

- GPS (L1CA enabled by default)
- Galileo
- BeiDou
- GLONASS
